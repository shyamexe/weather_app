# Weather App

This is a simple weather app built with Flutter that displays the current weather for a given location. The app uses the weatherapi.com API to fetch the weather data and displays it in a user-friendly interface.



## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application that follows the
[simple app state management
tutorial](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/simple).

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

`Note: You'll need to provide your own weatherapi.com API key in order to fetch weather data. To do this, create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add the following line:`
